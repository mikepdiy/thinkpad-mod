# thinkpad-mod
This repo is hosting a few documents that are realted to a product that I make and it is part of and initiative to keep older Lenovo Thinkpad laptops from landfill. Thus I decided to reduce the amount of waste present in my packaging and go paper free with the help of document hosting on GitHub in a repo. </br>
